Belly Button Biodiversity


I build an interactive dashboard that shows the Belly Button Biodiversity regarding microbes that colonize human navels.
The results reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

The following steps occured to created this dashboard.
Read in a .json data file that was provided with the results of this study.
Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
The bar chart has hover text over the data that shows the OTU Labels.
Th bubble chart has different colors based on thte OTU_ids and sizes based on the sample Values.
There is also a demographic chart which displays the selected indivuidals demographic information: id, ethnicity, gender, age, olcation bbtype, and wfreq.
All graphs and charts update to each time a new subject's id is selected.
